CMPS2212 GUI PROGRAMMING

  In this lab, I worked with JavaScript functions, objects and prototypes. I practiced writing different kinds of
  functions using map, filter and reduce on arrays, and creating objects with methods. I also learned how to use
  Object.create() to make prototype chains, override methods and figure out which properties are my own vs inherited.
